# renternet
## you're not meant to be here.
the renternet is a signal beyond the staticâ€”a fragmented transmission looping through forgotten frequencies. a network without origin, a place where memory and reality converge. you are connected. you have always been connected
## about this project
this is my first time playing with stuff like this. i have very little knowledge of coding, etc. i am learning as i go. i wanted to create an interesting and artsy interface for a webpage that will host links to things hosted on my personal server (also a work in progress). i also wanted it to be password protected, so only my friends and people i invite would be able to access the actual webpage. still not 100% sure how i will be implementing this but i'm excited to learn!
# the signal is weak, but you are still here.
